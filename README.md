# Revenue Interface

This is a simple revenue interface I made for a coding challenge. Features include
a page summary with relevant data, an adjustable line graph comparing monthly
revenues over past months, a table listing all subscriptions, and a form for entering new subscriptions.

### Backend

While my backend experience has primarily been with Rails, I knew I didn't need
something so heavy duty for such a simple application. Instead, I chose to use Node.js and the
lightweight Express framework for my server.

### Front End

For the front end I used the tools I'm most familiar with: React and Redux, with
[`redux-saga`](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) for handling side effects.
